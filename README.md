# linked-list project
	
This was my first project delving into a linear data structure and some methods that work on the data. I mostly used iterative approaches to work on the data, but if I was to continue to work on this project and change some things I would probably try to implement recursive methods as well. 

## What I learned

- Working with pointers
- Changing and editing data in a linear structure
- How to implement algorithms to work on a linear data strtucture
